                        Formula One (also known as Formula 1 or F1) is the highest class of international racing for
                        open-wheel single-seater formula racing cars sanctioned by the <strong>FIA</strong>. The World
                        Drivers'
                        Championship, which became the FIA Formula One World
                        Championship in 1981, has been one of the premier forms of racing around the world since its
                        inaugural season in 1950. The word formula in the name refers to the set of rules to which all
                        participants' cars must conform.A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as
                        Grands Prix, which take place worldwide on both purpose-built circuits and closed public roads.
                        <br>
                        A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: one for
                        drivers, the other for constructors. Each driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the
                        highest
                        class of racing licence issued by the FIA.The races must run on tracks graded "1" (formerly
                        "A"), the highest grade-rating issued by the FIA.Formula One cars are the fastest regulated
                        road-course racing cars in the world, owing to
                        very
                        high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large amounts of aerodynamic
                        downforce. The cars underwent major changes in 2017,allowing wider front and rear wings, and
                        wider
                        tyres, resulting in peak cornering forces near 6.5 lateral g and top speeds of around 350
                        km/h
                        (215 mph).As of

                            2021, the hybrid engines are limited in performance to a maximum of
                            15,000 rpm; the cars are very dependent on electronics and aerodynamics, suspension and
                            tyres.

                        The Formula One series originated with the European Championship of Grand Prix motor racing of
                        the 1920s and 1930s. The formula consists of a set of rules that all participants' cars must
                        meet. Formula One was a new formula agreed upon during 1946 with the first non-championship
                        races taking place that year. The first Formula 1 race was the 1946 Turin Grand Prix. A number
                        of Grand Prix racing organisations had laid out rules for a world championship before World War
                        II, but due to the suspension of racing during the conflict, the World Drivers' Championship did
                        not become formalised until 1947. The first world championship race took place at Silverstone in
                        the United Kingdom in 1950. Giuseppe Farina in his Alfa Romeo won the first World Championship
                        for Drivers in 1950, narrowly defeating his teammate Juan Manuel Fangio. However, Fangio won the
                        title in 1951, 1954, 1955, 1956, and 1957 (his record of five World Championship titles stood
                        for 45 years until Michael Schumacher took his sixth title in 2003). Fangio's streak was
                        interrupted (after an injury) by two-time champion Alberto Ascari of Ferrari.
                        <br>

                        Juan Manuel Fangio's 1951 title-winning Alfa Romeo 159
                        A championship for constructors followed in 1958. Although the UK's Stirling Moss was able to
                        compete regularly, he was never able to win the world championship and has been described by The
                        Independent as "The greatest driver to never win the world championship".In a seven-year
                        span between 1955 and 1961, Moss finished as championship runner-up four times and in third
                        place the other three times.Fangio, however, achieved the record of winning 24 of the
                        52 races he entered - a record that holds to this day.National championships existed in
                        South Africa and the UK in the 1960s and 1970s. Non-championship Formula One events were held by
                        promoters for many years, but due to the increasing cost of competition, the last of these
                        occurred in 1983.This period

                            Mercedes-Benz,
                            and Maserati. The first seasons featured pre-war cars like Alfa's 158. They were
                            front-engined,
                            with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre naturally aspirated engines. The
                            1952
                            and 1953 World Championships were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful
                            cars, due to concerns over the lack of Formula One cars available.When a new Formula
                            One formula for engines limited to 2.5 litres was reinstated to the world championship for
                            1954,
                            Mercedes-Benz introduced the advanced W196. This featured innovations such as desmodromic
                            valves
                            and fuel injection, as well as enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the
                            championship for two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport in the wake of the
                            1955
